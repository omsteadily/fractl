# Materials for Freelance Project Manager/Data Journalist Position

Here are some samples of recent work that demonstrates proficiency in areas that are potentially relevant to the role you have in mind, based on your description of the job.  I will contextualize them here, and am happy to answer questions or provide further elaboration if you like.

## Writing Samples

Although most of my career has been spent writing, most of my professional writing is not available - the work I did as an analyst is non-public, and the writing I did for the theatre was long enough ago that it no longer exists on the website.  I've included some of the writing that I've done for school, although it may not be tonally appropriate for data journalism.

### [Observational Trial Critique](https://github.com/omsteadily/fractl/tree/master/w241Essay1.pdf)

The assignment was to identify an observational trial with questionable assertions, and critique how causation may have been implied from correlational data.  I chose a trial on female sexuality with some rather startling conclusions.

### [Field Experiment Pitch](https://github.com/omsteadily/fractl/tree/master/w241Essay2.pdf)

Again for a class on statistical analysis and field experiments, this is a pitch for a project that could be done within the auspices of the course.  In keeping with my interest in language analysis and social networks, this is an experiment to determine whether Twitter's algorithm is optimized to induce outrage.

### [Intralingual Translation without Reference via Gradient Ascent](https://github.com/omsteadily/fractl/w266_Final_Project.pdf)

This was a group project, but I did the bulk of the writing (up to section 2.4.1.2 CNN).  In addition to the writing, this document details the process I conceived for "translating" a sentence between topics without reference by using gradient ascent in latent space (inspired by Google DeepDream).  To my knowledge, nobody has used an encoder/decoder with text in this manner.

## Data Visualization

### [Pandas - BikeShare and Parking Ticket Analysis](https://github.com/omsteadily/fractl/tree/master/Pandas%20-%20BikeShare%20and%20Parking%20Ticket%20Analysis)
This was a culminatory project to demonstrate proficiency in data import and analysis using Python/Pandas.  We chose to see if there was any interesting relationship between the introduction of bike sharing and the issuance of parking tickets in New York.  It turned out there wasn't, but it was still a fun project that involved some tricky data cleanup and the development of a geocoding pipeline.  This was a group project, and my primary responsibility was the final section, which examined the intersection of the two datasets, with visualizations using Plotly and Gmaps.

### [SK Learn - PASSNYC Minority Admissions](https://github.com/omsteadily/W207-final-project/blob/bd14b33dd14629c1ae3e0d6fcb57f86a782e4752/final_project_overview.ipynb)
PASSNYC is an organization dedicated to increasing minority enrollment at New York's elite specialized high schools.  They partnered with Kaggle for a Data For Good competition to see if they could improve their targeting of and engagement with underrepresented middle schools within the five boroughs.  Although we were disqualified from entry because we had a Google employee on our team (Google owns Kaggle), we elected to attempt the competition regardless and simply passed along the results to PASSNYC to review in case they found anything useful.

It was an ambitious group project, covering substantial data manipulation (both Pandas and Numpy) as well as incorporating and analyzing four classifiers - K-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forests, Logistic Regression and Neural Nets.  My specific focus was Logistic Regression, and I'm particularly proud of the post-hoc analysis that involved (especially the heatmaps).  However, we all worked together and approved all aspects, so I wasn't working in isolation.

I've included a copy of my resume here as well.  Thank you for your time and attention.
