# BikeShare and Parking Ticket analysis with Python Pandas
This was a sample data analysis project to demonstrate proficiency with Pandas in Python.  My team chose the datasets and scope of the project, and my section was the intersection of the two datasets, for an analysis of whether and to what degree the installation of CitiBike docks in Park Slope/Cobble Hill had on parking violations in the area.  The details of the analysis, including data wrangling, cleanup and pipeline are in the PDF while the code itself is in the Jupyter Notebook.  The data itself is too large to put on Github (>6 GB), but there are links to all of the datasets involved included in the report if you feel inspired to look at them yourself.
